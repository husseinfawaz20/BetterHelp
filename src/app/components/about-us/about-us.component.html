  <h1> <b> About Us </b></h1>

    <h3>To face the financial crisis happening in Lebanon, institutions, municipalities and some rich people are helping those in need.
    <br>We always hear about some families in need who havenâ€™t received their portion of aid due to the disorganized way of distribution.</h3>
<br>
    <h1> <b>How can we achieve equal and fair distribution of aid to all those in need? </b></h1>

  <h3>This is where we play a vital part in solving this dilemma. We ensure everything <br>
       distributed is counted and delivered proficiently through the municipality. </h3>
